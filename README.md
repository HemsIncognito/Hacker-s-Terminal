# 🧠 Hacker's Terminal Simulator 💻

A fake hacker terminal that looks like you're deep in the matrix 🧪. Designed to mimic Hollywood-style hacking animations — the kind of thing you see when someone “accesses a secure mainframe” in 5 seconds. All visuals, no backend, pure aesthetic.


## 🎬 What It Does

The moment you open the site:

- Green numbers rain down the screen (Matrix-style effect)
- Commands auto-type themselves like:
  - `Fetching secure data...`
  - `Bypassing firewall...`
  - `Deleting logs...`
  - `Clearing traces...`
- Looks like you're running a super elite hack in progress


## 🛠️ Built With

- HTML5
- CSS3 (custom animation)
- JavaScript (timed typing, visual effects)
- No external libraries — lightweight and fast
